# Interview Pal
Interview Pal is a tool that helps candidates prepare for technical and behavioural interviews. We use AI to analyse a job description and a resume to find points of intersection with respect to skills, experience, etc. and craft questions that are unique to the user's skill set and work experience. 

The project is a work in progress at the moment, but we are excited to see where it goes!
